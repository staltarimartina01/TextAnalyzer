A THING—a mere trifle—has undone me! You, who call me mad, know nothing of the exquisite torment of perception. My hearing, I say, my hearing has become a curse upon me. Not the beating of that hideous heart—no, that came later—but a sound far more insidious: the relentless ticking of the clock in the hall below.

Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock. It drilled into my brain, a monstrous insect boring into the very marrow of my sanity. I tried to ignore it, to lose myself in the pages of my books, but the sound persisted—a metallic pulse echoing through the silent house. I grew to loathe it, to see it as a living entity mocking my peace.

With what precision I planned its silencing! For seven nights I descended the staircase, each step a monument to my caution. The moonlight, piercing through the stained glass, cast long, accusing shadows. I would stand for hours before the clock, studying its brass pendulum, my hand trembling not from fear, but from a terrible, mounting ecstasy.

On the eighth night, I acted. I did not smash it—that would be too crude, too final. No, I opened its glass face with infinite care and stilled the pendulum with a single, deliberate touch. The silence that followed was more terrible than the sound. For in that silence, I heard the true madness begin—the frantic, thunderous beating of my own heart, a sound I now know will never cease.
